# Reverb Records #

Reverb Records is a simple Rack app, Grape API, and CSV database manager. 

To get up and running, you'll need Bundler installed. Then, `bundle install`.

To start the app, type `rackup`. Visit [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292/) to see the example page. 

There you can see the data that currently lives in the CSV database, located at db/database.csv.


To run the specs, just type `rspec`. This project uses [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov), so you can see the numbers by opening `/coverage/index.html`.
